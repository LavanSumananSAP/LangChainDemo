    "# Intro to LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "- LLM applications can be difficult to build and manage\n",
    "- LangChain provides a framework for building modular components and chaining them together to produce an LLM app\n",
    "- LangChain also provides plenty example apps and tools for connecting to various components (e.g. databases)\n",
    "- LangServe and LangSmith are additional tools for exposing an LLM app as a REST API and testing/debugging/monitoring respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "- Document question answering\n",
    "- Chatbots\n",
    "- Analyzing structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Demo\n",
    "We'll create a simple app that takes natural language input, queries a database, and gives natural language output with LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Expose the app to consumers as a REST API with LangServe\n",
    "- Test, debug, and monitor the app with LangSmith"
